# Boot, Paging & Common Memory — Quick Reference

A human-friendly map of how Open CP/M +3 gets from "ROM hands us PC=FE10" to
"CCP prompt at A>". Every time something breaks, check the labels and stage
boundaries here first. Source files referenced inline.

---

## 1. Banking modes (port `0x1FFD`)

The +3 has four 16K slots: `0000-3FFF`, `4000-7FFF`, `8000-BFFF`, `C000-FFFF`.
"Special paging" (1FFD bit 0 = 1, bits 2:1 = mode) selects a fixed bank quartet.
Bit 3 is the disk motor — we OR it in via `motor_flag` on every write.

| Mode | 1FFD val | 0000-3FFF | 4000-7FFF | 8000-BFFF | C000-FFFF | Used for |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 0    | `0x01`   | bank 0    | bank 1    | bank 2    | **bank 3** | TPA — user/CCP code runs here |
| 2    | `0x05`   | bank 4    | bank 5    | bank 6    | **bank 3** | Boot loader; screen RAM access |
| 3    | `0x07`   | bank 4    | bank 7    | bank 6    | **bank 3** | System — BIOS, BDOS, drivers |

**Bank 3 (`C000-FFFF`) is always mapped.** That's why every page-switching
helper, the BDOS dispatcher, the ISR, FCB buffers, and the BDOS stack live in
bank 3 at `F600-FFFF` (the "common memory stub"). If you put writable code or
data anywhere else and try to bank-switch, you lose access mid-instruction.

`BANK0_1FFD = 0x01`, `BANK1_1FFD = 0x07`, `MOTOR_BIT = 0x08` — see
`src/bios/bios.zpa:42-44`.

## 2. Boot sequence — stage by stage

```
ROM ──> boot sector ──> loader ──> CPM3.SYS init ──> cold_boot ──> warm_boot ──> CCP
       (FE00, 512B)    (0000)     (C000)            (bank 4)      (bank 4)     (TPA)
```

### Stage 0 — +3 ROM

`DOS_BOOT` reads logical sector 0 (512 bytes), checks `sum mod 256 == 3`, copies
it to `0xFE00` in **mode 2** (banks 4-5-6-3), and jumps to `0xFE10`. PC=FE10,
DI not yet asserted.

### Stage 1 — boot sector (`src/boot/bootsect.asm`)

- `org 0xFE00`. Bytes 0-15 are a header. Entry at `0xFE10`.
- `di`; `ld sp, 0xFE00`; turn motor on (`1FFD = 0x0D` = mode 2 + motor).
- Reads track 0 sectors 2-9 (4KB) into `0x0000` via direct uPD765A I/O.
- `jp 0x0000`.

### Stage 2 — loader (`src/boot/loader.asm`)

- `org 0x0000`. Still in mode 2. Stack moved to `BIOS_ADDR = 0xC000` so a
  16K system image padded to FE00 doesn't trample the loader's stack.
- Seeks track 1 (OFF=1), scans the directory (sectors 1-4) for `CPM3    SYS`.
- Walks the matched directory entry's allocation map (16 block pointers, 1K
  each = 2 physical sectors), loading each block to `BIOS_ADDR` and bumping.
- `jp BIOS_ADDR` (= `0xC000`).

The system image lands in **bank 3** at `C000-FFFF` because that's what mode 2
maps there.

### Stage 3 — CPM3.SYS init (`src/bios/bios.zpa:59-92`)

Runs at `C000` in bank 3. **One-shot setup** — its job is to relocate the
real code into the right banks before jumping into bank 4.

```
   C000 --init--+
                +--> LDIR     system_image   --> 0000 (bank 4 @ 0000-3FFF, mode 2)
                +--> LDIR/LDDR common_image  --> F600 (bank 3)
                +--> jp cold_boot              (bank 4)
```

The system-image copy must happen before installing common. `CPM3.SYS` is
loaded in bank 3 at `C000-FFFF`; with `COMMON_BASE=F600`, the common-memory
destination overlaps the physical source bytes for the tail of `system_image`.
Copying common first corrupts the bytes that are later relocated into bank 4,
usually showing up as no `A>` prompt or BDOS walking through SCB-looking data.

Direction of the common-memory copy is still decided at assembly time (`IF
common_image < COMMON_BASE` -> LDDR else LDIR) so the common copy itself does
not clobber overlapping source/destination ranges. The system-image copy uses
LDIR with an assert that `system_image >= 0x0000 + size` — i.e. source is above
destination.

After init, **bank 3 still holds the rest of the loaded CPM3.SYS image at
C000-F5FF, but nothing references it again** — it's just whatever the loader
deposited there. Common memory at F600+ is the live copy.

### Stage 4 — `cold_boot` (`src/bios/bios.zpa:168-203`, runs in bank 4)

```
di
ld sp, bdos_stack       ; common-memory stack (F600+ region)
call scr_init           ; clear screen, set attrs
call kbd_init           ; reset keyboard state
call fdc_init           ; recalibrate FDC
call load_fonts         ; pull FONT51/FONT32 into bank 6
call load_fid           ; optional: register C: ramdisk if RAMDISK.FID present
call motor_off          ; spin down before CCP
print signon
patch SCB:              scb_common = scb_base; scb_tpa = bdos_stub
install ISR vector at 0x0038 (system bank's bank 4 page zero)
fall through ──> warm_boot
```

### Stage 5 — `warm_boot` (`src/bios/bios.zpa:211-232`)

```
di
ld sp, bdos_stack
copy_block_to_tpa(ccp_stored ──> 0x0100, ccp_stored_end-ccp_stored)
                                ; cross-bank copy: bank 4 → bank 0
ld (disk_dma), 0x0080
clear xmove_active, dma_bank, multi_count
jp start_tpa            ; in common memory — never returns
```

### Stage 6 — `start_tpa` (`src/bios/common.zpa:477-511`)

Runs in common memory because it switches *out* of bank 4.

```
1FFD ←── motor_flag | BANK0_1FFD     ; mode 0 (TPA banks)
0000: JP bios_visible+3              ; WBOOT vector — programs read 0001
0005: JP bdos_stub                   ; BDOS vector — programs read 0006
0038: EI; RETI                       ; minimal ISR for TPA (Mallard overwrites this)
im 1; ei
jp 0x0100                            ; CCP entry
```

That's the boot. From this point, the CPU is running in mode 0 with the CCP
mapped at `0x0100`, and only the `F600-FFFF` common stub bridges it back to
bank 4 when the user calls BDOS or BIOS.

---

## 3. Memory map after boot

### Mode 0 (TPA — what user programs see)

| Range       | Contents                                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0000-00FF` | Page zero. JP at 0000 → WBOOT, JP at 0005 → bdos_stub.    |
| `0100-`     | CCP (loaded from `ccp_stored` blob in bank 4).            |
| up to TPA top | TPA proper — programs load and run here.                |
| `F600-F5FF`*  | (bank 3, always visible) — common stub starts at F600.  |
| `F600-FFFF` | SCB, bios_visible jump table, **bdos_stub**, BDOS stack, FCB buf, dirbuf, drive table, XDPHs/XDPBs. |

`bdos_stub`'s address is the published top-of-TPA. Anything mutable placed
*before* it gets overwritten by the TPA stack growing down. There's a static
assert on this in `common.zpa:167`.

### Mode 3 (System — BDOS/BIOS bank)

| Range       | Contents                                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0000-3FFF` | Bank 4. BIOS jump table at 0000, then state, drivers, font/FID loaders, embedded CCP, BDOS. Asserted ≤ 16K (`system_end <= 0x4000`). |
| `0038`      | ISR vector — JP isr_handler (in common memory).           |
| `4000-7FFF` | Bank 7. System data / growth (currently unused).          |
| `8000-BFFF` | Bank 6. Font data at `8000` (FONT51) and `8800` (FONT32); RAMDISK.FID at `9000` if loaded. |
| `F600-FFFF` | Common stub (bank 3). Same content as in mode 0 — that's the point. |

---

## 4. Common memory layout (bank 3, `F600-FFFF`)

This is the most fragile region. **Order matters.** The TPA stack grows down
from `bdos_stub`, so anything writable above `bdos_stub` corrupts on the first
deep call from a user program. Source: `src/bios/common.zpa`.

### Pinned addresses (don't move these without coordinated changes)

| Address  | What                          | Why pinned                                                       |
|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0xF9A1` | `copy_record_to_tpa`          | RAMDISK.FID hardcodes it; assert at common.zpa:802.              |
| `0xF9A7` | `copy_record_from_tpa`        | Same — assert at common.zpa:803.                                 |
| `bdos_stub` | itself                     | scb_tpa = this address; user stacks set SP to it.                |
| SCB offsets `0x05, 0x1A, 0x3A, 0x3C, 0x3E, 0x44, 0x58-0x5C, 0x62` | DRI documented | Programs index off scb_base.    |

If common memory grows past these offsets, FID modules break with no error
message — just silent garbage on disk I/O. The asserts are your tripwire.

---

## 5. Stacks — three of them

| Stack             | Lives in          | Used when                                         | Loaded with                       |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Boot loader stack | (transient) FE00, then C000 | While loader.asm executes (stage 2)     | `ld sp, 0xC000`                   |
| TPA / user stack  | TPA (bank 0), grows down from `bdos_stub` | Whenever mode 0 is active   | Saved/restored as `saved_sp`     |
| BDOS stack        | Common memory (`bdos_stack`)              | Inside `bdos_stub`, `warm_boot_stub`, ISR, BIOS calls | `ld sp, bdos_stack` (top), 128 B |
| Trampoline stack  | Common (`_bc4_stack`)                     | The 6 pushes inside `bios_call_bank4` while it's actually flipping 1FFD | Hard-coded, 12 bytes |

**Why we need a separate trampoline stack:** the user's stack may be in bank 1
(`4000-7FFF`), which becomes bank 7 after switching to system mode. A push
mid-switch would land in the wrong physical RAM. The trampoline stack is in
bank 3 (always visible) so its content survives the switch.

The BDOS stack is also in common memory for the same reason — `bdos_stub` is
itself called from TPA mode and switches banks before invoking the real BDOS.
See the dance in `common.zpa:161-210`.

---

## 6. The BDOS dispatch — what happens at `CALL 0x0005`

```
TPA mode 0          common stub (bank 3)               system mode 3
─────────             ──────────────                    ────────────
JP bdos_stub  ────►   bdos_stub:
                        di
                        save SP → saved_sp
                        SP ← bdos_stack
                        push BC, DE                ; preserve fn,param
                        write_1ffd(motor|BANK1_1FFD) ; ─ now in mode 3
                        ei                                              ──►
                        pop DE, BC
                        call bdos_entry        ──►  real BDOS in bank 4 runs here
                                                    (fn handler, may call BIOS)
                                                                         ◄──
                        di
                        push HL, AF, BC                ; save return values
                        write_1ffd(motor|BANK0_1FFD)   ; ─ back to mode 0
                        pop BC, AF, HL
                        SP ← saved_sp
                        ei
                        ret  ────────────►  user
```

Important: the system bank's `0x0000` is the BIOS jump table (33 × `JP`), so
when bank 4 is mapped, address 0 gives you `JP cold_boot`. That's why the
TPA's page zero (in bank 0) has to be reconstructed each time we drop back —
luckily we don't, because mode 0 maps a *different* bank 0 with the JPs we
wrote in `start_tpa`.
